	abstract = {Software game is a kind of application that is used not only for entertainment, but also for serious purposes that can be applicable to different domains such as education, business, and health care. Multidisciplinary nature of the game development processes that combine sound, art, control systems, artificial intelligence ({AI}), and human factors, makes the software game development practice different from traditional software development. However, the underline software engineering techniques help game development to achieve maintainability, flexibility, lower effort and cost, and better design. The purpose of this study is to assesses the state of the art research on the game development software engineering process and highlight areas that need further consideration by researchers. In the study, we used a systematic literature review methodology based on well-known digital libraries. The largest number of studies have been reported in the production phase of the game development software engineering process life cycle, followed by the pre-production phase. By contrast, the post-production phase has received much less research activity than the pre-production and production phases. The results of this study suggest that the game development software engineering process has many aspects that need further attention from researchers; that especially includes the postproduction phase.},

We aimed to determine whether Footgaming in the classroom results in learning nutritional concepts. The experiences of student participation and teachers’ perceptions of using active gaming in the classroom were reported. A total of 57 students played computerized nutritional games utilizing their feet to control mouse functions on a Footgaming pad (Cobalt Flux, Salt Lake City, {UT}). Nutritional knowledge was assessed at baseline and following 10 weeks of Footgaming. These preliminary findings suggest children can learn nutritional concepts and teachers and students value the educational experience when using Footgaming in the classroom. These findings are an important step in improving the understanding of physical activity–based technologies in the classroom setting.},

	abstract = {Abstract.— In the past decade, the academic community has increased considerably its activity concerning the teaching and learning of evolution. Despite such beneficial activity, the state of public understanding of evolution is considered woefully lacking by most researchers and educators. This lack of understanding affects evolution/science literacy, research, and academia in general. Not only does the general public lack an understanding of evolution but so does a considerable proportion of college graduates. However, it is not just evolutionary concepts that students do not retain. In general, college students retain little of what they supposedly have learned. Worse yet, it is not just students who have avoided science and math who fail to retain fundamental science concepts. Students who have had extensive secondary-level and college courses in science have similar deficits. We examine these issues and explore what distinguishes effective pedagogy from ineffective pedagogy in higher education in general and evolution education in particular. The fundamental problem of students' prior conceptions is considered and why prior conceptions often underpin students' misunderstanding of the evolutionary concepts being taught. These conceptions can often be discovered and addressed. We also attend to concerns about coverage of course content and the influence of religious beliefs, and provide helpful strategies to improve college-level teaching of evolution.},

The orbits of the asteroid before and after lunar flybys are investigated for different Jacobi constants in the restricted three body problem. The capture will happen when the post-flyby Jacobi constant reaches certain value due to the flyby. The capture regions of different pre-flyby initial Jacobi constants are numerically explored in the diagram that is represented by two defined angles. To give an intuitive description of the capture region, it is represented by the orbital elements of the asteroid. Based on this capture region, the asteroids that can be captured through lunar flybys are chosen from the asteroid database. Finally, the capture processes of selected asteroids are validated through the ephemerides model.},

Initial applications of the {GameFlow} model were limited to real-time strategy games. However, in order to be considered a general model of player enjoyment in games, the {GameFlow} model needs to be applied to a more varied set of play experiences. In this article, we revisit the design of the {GameFlow} model, review the various applications and derivative models, and discuss on-going analysis of the model. Subsequently, we describe a study that aims to extend the initial validation of the {GameFlow} model to incorporate additional game types. We report the results of expert reviews conducted using the {GameFlow} criteria to evaluate first person shooter games on Sony {PlayStation} 3 and adventure games on Apple {iPhone}. Our findings provide insight into the manifestation of the {GameFlow} elements in these types of games and also highlight some of the genre-specific considerations in the application of the {GameFlow} model. Key issues are raised and discussed in relation to immersion, social interaction, and multiplayer games.},

Derived from a general set of heuristics for creating enjoyable player experiences, the {GameFlow} model has been widely used in evaluating many types of games, as well as non-game applications. However, we recognize that more specific, low-level, and implementable criteria are potentially more useful for designing and evaluating video games. Consequently, the research reported in this paper aims to provide detailed heuristics for designing and evaluating one specific game genre, real-time strategy games. In order to develop these heuristics, we conducted a grounded theoretical analysis on a set of professional game reviews and structured the resulting heuristics using the {GameFlow} model. The resulting 165 heuristics for designing and evaluating real-time strategy games are presented and discussed in this paper.},

More particularly they fail to adopt a socio-constructivist view of learning. We propose an approach that adapts the idea of usability heuristics by taking account of a socio-constructivist learning perspective. This leads to a set of `learning with software' heuristics. A notable feature of these heuristics is that they attend to the integration of usability and learning issues.},

We show that when irradiated with a simulated Martian {UV} flux, perchlorates become bacteriocidal. At concentrations associated with Martian surface regolith, vegetative cells of Bacillus subtilis in Martian analogue environments lost viability within minutes. Two other components of the Martian surface, iron oxides and hydrogen peroxide, act in synergy with irradiated perchlorates to cause a 10.8-fold increase in cell death when compared to cells exposed to {UV} radiation after 60 seconds of exposure. These data show that the combined effects of at least three components of the Martian surface, activated by surface photochemistry, render the present-day surface more uninhabitable than previously thought, and demonstrate the low probability of survival of biological contaminants released from robotic and human exploration missions.},
